# GOGC

## Introduction
GOGC is a standalone Windows application that implements a Graph-optimized–based tool for Graphic correlation problem, as described in our accompanying article.  
This repository also includes:
- **Paper_data**: all input datasets used in the paper (see the `Paper_data/` folder)  
- **Outputs**: the optimal outputs obtained by **GOGC** and by the comparative **CONOP** method (see the `Outputs/` folder)  

You can run the application without MATLAB installed—only the free MATLAB Runtime is required.

## Prerequisites
- **MATLAB Runtime R2021a (9.10)**  
  Download and install the MATLAB Runtime from:  
  https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from this repository.  
2. Unpack the archive so that `GOGC.exe`, `Userguide.docx` (and optionally `MCRInstaller.exe`) reside in the same folder.

## Usage
Refer to **Userguide.docx** for full instructions. In brief, from a command prompt:
