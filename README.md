# GOGC

## Introduction
GOGC is a standalone Windows application that implements a Graph-optimized–based tool for Graphic correlation problem, as described in our accompanying article.  
This repository also includes:
- **Paper_data**: all input datasets used in the paper (see the `Paper_data/` folder)  
- **Outputs**: the optimal outputs obtained by **GOGC** and by the comparative **CONOP** method (see the `Outputs/` folder)  

You can run the application without MATLAB installed—only the free MATLAB Runtime is required.

## Prerequisites
